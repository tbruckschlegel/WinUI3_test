Summary
-------

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple web browser application using WinUI 3 and WebView2. The application features basic web navigation, including backward and forward navigation, page reload, and URL entry functionality. Additionally, the WebView2 control handles opening and displaying web pages within the application.

### Key Features:

1.  **Web Navigation**:
    
    *   **Back Button**: Allows navigation to the previous page.
    *   **Forward Button**: Enables moving forward through previously visited pages.
    *   **Reload Button**: Reloads the current page.
    *   **Go Button**: Navigates to a URL entered in the URL text box.
2.  **WebView2 Integration**:
    
    *   The `WebView2` control is used to render web pages. A default URL is loaded when the application starts.
    *   New window requests (e.g., links that would normally open in a new window) are captured and handled in the same WebView2 instance.
3.  **Localized UI**:
    
    *   Localized strings are used for button labels such as "Back", "Forward", "Reload", and "Go".
4.  **Event Handling**:
    
    *   Events such as button clicks and URL text changes are managed to control the behavior of the browser.

### XAML Overview:

The XAML file defines the layout for the main window, including:

*   A `StackPanel` for navigation controls (Back, Forward, Reload, Go, and a TextBox for URL input).
*   A `WebView2` control for displaying web content.

### C# Code Overview:

*   The `MainWindow` class initializes the `WebView2` and handles user interactions with the navigation buttons.
*   The `InitializeAsync` method ensures that `WebView2` is ready and sets a default URL.
*   Methods like `BackButton_Click`, `ForwardButton_Click`, `ReloadButton_Click`, and `GoButton_Click` control navigation and page reload.
*   The `CoreWebView2_NewWindowRequested` event is used to prevent new windows from opening outside of the WebView2 instance, instead opening them within the same WebView2.

### How to Extend:

*   You can modify the `WebView2` instance to handle multiple tabs.
*   Additional features like bookmarking, history management, or custom browser settings could be added.
